# VQ-UNET Implementation
## Overview
This project implements the VQ-UNET architecture, which combines the concepts of Vector Quantization (VQ) and U-Net for image generation and reconstruction tasks. The model leverages skip connections and codebooks to enhance performance and maintain high-quality outputs.
