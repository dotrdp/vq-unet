# My VQ-UNET Project

## Overview
This project implements the VQ-UNET architecture, which combines the concepts of Vector Quantization (VQ) and U-Net for image generation and reconstruction tasks. The model leverages skip connections and codebooks to enhance performance and maintain high-quality outputs.

## Installation
To set up the project, clone the repository and install the required packages using the following commands:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd my-vq-unet-project
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. **Data Preparation**: Place your dataset in the `data` directory. Ensure that the dataset is compatible with the custom dataset class defined in `src/dataset.py`.

2. **Configuration**: Modify the `configs/experiment_config.py` file to set your hyperparameters, dataset paths, and model parameters.

3. **Training**: Run the Jupyter notebook `vq_unet_experiment.ipynb` to start training the VQ-UNET model. The notebook includes sections for data loading, model training, and evaluation.

4. **Evaluation**: After training, you can evaluate the model's performance using the provided methods in the notebook.
